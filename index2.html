          <p>Hi there, you guys... This is my first Modal!</p>
          <p>
            I have created this Modal following the tutorial made by Brad
            Traversy. He is my favorite teacher. There is just so much great
            things I have learned from him, so I hope this can work as a tiny
            tribute to all of the things he has taught me :)

          <h3>Modal Footer</h3>
